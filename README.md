1.4 Project Scope 
The objective of the project is to build a computerised Silk Road system to handle restaurant bill 
records and record orders made by customers. Additionally, allowing employees to view and keep 
restaurant records as they wish. 
To protect the privacy and security of records, employees have limited access. The database is 
stored throughout the entire duration of the project. 

1.5 Project Objective 
The main objective of making the restaurant management system is to increase the monthly 
income effectively and reduce the mistakes that are always made by the restaurant management 
to attract customers to come to the store and be able to be competitive healthily. The following 
are the objectives applied in this paper: 
i) To aid in the more effective and efficient management of the restaurant by computerised 
inventory control, billing, and meal ordering. 
ii) To prevent the lack of communication that is caused by handwriting from waiter to chef. 
iii) To avoid mistakes when taking orders and lack of time management.
